# Faceless Food Hacks â€” Starter Site

Quick-start single-page React starter using Tailwind CDN (good for prototyping).
Files included:
- index.html (Tailwind via CDN)
- src/main.jsx
- src/App.jsx (landing page + newsletter form)
- vite config provided via package.json scripts

How to run (locally):
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open the printed local URL.

Deploy:
- Vercel/Netlify: connect repo and build with `npm run build`.
- For quick testing you can also open `index.html` directly (but dev server recommended).

Next steps I can do:
- Replace placeholder copy and images with niche-specific content for Food Hacks.
- Generate 10 SEO blog outlines and 3-email sequence.
- Add real integrations (Mailchimp/Stripe) and server endpoints.
